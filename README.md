# Highland #

*Highland* is a premium theme for e107 which can be used for corporate and personal websites. It makes use of all the great new features in e107 v2 and is continously updated to reflect the latest developments. 

The theme comes with different layouts which can be assigned to different pages. In addition there is room for changing a lot of preferences in the *Theme options* section in the Admin Area of your e107 installation.


## Requirements ##
* e107 v2.x (latest)
* PHP 5.3+
* Willingness to read the documentation ;)

**To be clear**: e107 v1.x is not supported, nor is any PHP version prior to PHP 5.3! 

If your website is running on anything lower than PHP 5.3,  you are over  **FOUR YEARS  behind on schedule!** PHP 5.3.0 was released on the 30th of June 2009, do something!
