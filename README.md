# Highland #

*Highland* is a premium theme for e107 which can be used for both corporate, personal and community-based websites. *Highland* makes use of all the great new features in e107 v2 and is continously updated to reflect the latest developments. 

The theme provides different layouts, each which can be assigned to different pages. In addition, there is room for changing a lot of theme options by using the *Theme options* section in the Admin Area of your e107 installation.

## Buying the Highland theme ##
At this point, the theme is still being developed. Once development has reached a point at which the theme is ready for public usage, it will be released through the e107.org addon repository. You will then be able to buy *Highland* from your own v2 Admin Area, using your e107.org account. More details will be published once the theme gets closer to its release. 

Throughout the development process, I would like to have two or three people testing *Highland* to make sure it functions properly on all e107 installations. I'll publish more information on beta testing *Highland* when the theme is ready to be tested. 

## Requirements ##
* e107 v2.x (latest)
* PHP 5.3+

**To be clear**: e107 v1.x is not (and will not be) supported, nor is any PHP version prior to PHP 5.3! 

If your website is running on anything lower than PHP 5.3,  you are over  **FOUR YEARS  behind on schedule!** PHP 5.3.0 was released on the 30th of June 2009, do something!
